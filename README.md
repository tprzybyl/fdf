First graphic project. Load a file with a grid of integer, get an isometric map.

Load using one of the two maps available in the file, or use the generator to create any map. Or just type it down, it works aswell.

DISCLAIMER : This is the project as it was given the first time it was validated at the school, it is not being updated since. I will keep those projects as they were made first. (Especially for this one, i do am aware that it does leak, but i don't change it for educational purpose)
